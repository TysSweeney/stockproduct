# Stock Product Comparator
Comparator tracking stock price and keystone product prices for select companies

# How it works
The stock product comparator automatically pulls stock price data for Proctor & Gamble, The Vita Coco Company, and Kimberly-Clark and tracks changes against keystone products for each company, namely Tide Pods, Coconut Water, and Kleenex.

My Python scraper script, saved here as scraper.py, runs daily on PythonAnywhere and saves new data to a SQL database on Bit.io. CSV files here in GitHub are updated regularly, and feed into visualizations created with Datawrapper.
